"""Build a clangd compile_commands.json covering all of Ross's handwired boards.

`qmk compile --compiledb` writes a database for one keyboard, cleans `.build`
first, and never lists keymap.c (modern QMK compiles it by #include from
quantum/keymap_introspection.c). clangd then guesses flags for keymap.c from
whichever file is nearest, which is the wrong board for all but one keymap.

This script runs the generator per board, checks the database it wrote really
is that board's (a parse failure inside `--compiledb` leaves the previous file
in place and still exits 0), clones each board's keymap_introspection.c record
for its keymap.c, merges the databases (first board wins for shared files,
so quantum/, tmk_core/ and drivers/ are analysed with the first board's flags),
then rebuilds every board but the last so the generated
`.build/obj_*/src/default_keyboard.h` headers the database points at exist.
Each `--compiledb` run's own build is discarded by the next run's clean, so
nine compiles happen where five would do; that is the price of driving the
stable `qmk` CLI instead of importing its internals.

If generating the database fails or is interrupted, the previous
compile_commands.json is restored. A failure while rebuilding headers leaves
the new database in place and names the board to rebuild.

Usage: util/rharmes/compiledb.py   (works from any directory; takes ~3 minutes)
