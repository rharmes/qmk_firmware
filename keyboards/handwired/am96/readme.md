# AM96

A handwired almost-100% (96 keys) split ergo layout, with a central numpad. The left and right sides are based partially on the Ergodox layout (with modified stagger and thumb clusters), and the central numpad was inspired by Maltron. 

The name comes from the âŒ˜ symbol on the Command key (which has prominent placement in this layout). It [originated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key#Origin_of_the_symbol) on Nordic roadsigns as a place-of-interest indicator, and the Command key has been called _Fornminne_ ("ancient monument") by Swedish Mac users in reference to this. I have no particular connection to Sweden, but given that the keyboard is optimized for the Mac, I liked the folkore aspect of the name. 

Keyboard Maintainer: Ross Harmes
Hardware Availability: You will have to fabricate your own plate and case. I created mine out of five layers of 3mm baltic birch plywood using Easel and an X-Carve CNC router.

## Design goals
* A custom layout specific to my ergonomics
* One-piece construction, to prevent two halves from moving in distance and angle relative to each other
* A central numpad usable by either hand by shifting body position
* Layer keys with commonly used shortcuts
* Layer indicators using the RGB underglow features
* Low-profile (as close to switch + keycap height as I can get; ~30mm for swtitch + MT3 R0)
* Integrated palm rests
