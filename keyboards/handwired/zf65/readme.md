# ZF65

A handwired 60% (65 keys) fixed-split ergo layout. The left and right sides are based partially on the Ergodox layout (with modified stagger and very different thumb clusters).

-   **Keyboard Maintainer**: Ross Harmes
-   **Hardware Availability**: You will have to fabricate your own plate and case, and handwire the switches. I created a detailed guide to designing and building your own keyboard using this layout as my example: [makeakeyboard.com](https://makeakeyboard.com/)
-   **Layout**: [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/27afc6165a0862858f3a718ab72e5aab)
