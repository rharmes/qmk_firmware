# AM49

A handwired 60% (46 keys plus 3 macro keys) fixed-split ergo layout. The left and right sides are based partially on the Ergodox layout (with modified stagger and very different thumb clusters). 

The name comes from the âŒ˜ symbol on the Command key (which has prominent placement in this layout: it's a mod-tap on the thumbs' home positions). It [originated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key#Origin_of_the_symbol) on Nordic roadsigns as a place-of-interest indicator, and the Command key has been called _Fornminne_ ("ancient monument") by Swedish Mac users in reference to this. I have no particular connection to Sweden, but given that the keyboard is optimized for the Mac, I liked the folkore aspect of the name. 

The layout depends heavily on using home row mod-taps (since there are no stand-alone mod keys), and tries to keep fingers within 1U on their home positions (there is a number row, but the numpad layer means you don't have to use it).

Keyboard Maintainer: Ross Harmes
Hardware Availability: You will have to fabricate your own plate and case, and handwire the switches. I created a detailed guide to designing and building your own keyboard using this layout as my example: [makeakeyboard.com](https://makeakeyboard.com/).
